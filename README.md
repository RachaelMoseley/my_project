# India Water Quality System Analysis

## Problem Statement: This program will analyze the quality of water in India. User's will be able to access the data about different locations in India and it's water quality at that time or year. 

## Dataset
-- Source: I got my dataset on the website called Kaggle.
-- Description: "Combined data for Historical Water Quality in certain locations of India. Pollutants measures in each column is the average values measured over a period of time. source: "Indian government websites""
-- Size: It has 12 features.
--Quality: Updated 6 years ago.

## Features
